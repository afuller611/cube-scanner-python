Do things to get good contours (canny, kernel, dilate)

Determine if something is square (circularity of 0.785) between 0.7 and 0.9 is probs good
    contour, need area and perimeter

Draw square around that square

Once 9 are found, take a snapshot and get HSV or RGB colors of average of each of those squares

Repeat for all sides

(We could also ask for each colored side -- show us orange center, show us red center, etc. so we could use those as a baseline for next part)

We should now have 6 arrays of colors

Some kind of function to go through these arrays and get colors determined

Logical checks
    Middles should be 6 different colors
    Each color shouuld have 9 faces


Another option is to have squares on the screen and they line the cube up with those squares
